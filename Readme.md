The reason why I want to make maplestory by my self is for playing v83 version.
However, client source codes of v83 all are made for GMS. And none of them support chinese and difficult to build for other platform.

After I read `JournalStory` which inspires me that maybe I can write it by my self in java, because maplestory don't need high performance.
And there is no need other library for multi-language support.
Not only that, like opengl library also can be solved by libGDX one package.

Therefore, I could develop a platform independent clean MS by Java by using libGDX.


Thank JournalStory again, I write follow the idea of that.

Any thing totally in java. Music used jmp123 NX use NolifeNX but write by my self(not test all but test several bitmap and string, and change string format to UTF read, can't compatible with original NolifeNX. No license now, if necessary, please follow jmp123 license.
